> AVL Tree
>
> This project involved writing a class for an AVL Tree stored in a random access file. Each node contained a certain number of string fields specified by the user, and stored every node in a binary file rather than memory. This was my first project where I regularly read and wrote to a binary file and I discovered I enjoyed being able decode a node from a file rather than relying on it being in memory.
