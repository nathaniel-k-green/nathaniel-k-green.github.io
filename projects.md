# School Projects

The majority of school projects I have done were from my software design III class.

{: .highlight-title }
> Video Downloader for Panasonic HC-V785 Camera 
>
> I created a GUI application using Python which automatically downloads video files from a Panasonic HC-V785 Camera and creates a folder with a specific title and the days date. This project was born out of necessity because there was not a way to download videos from this specific camera without navigating through the terminal or downloading other software. I wanted to build a user friendly way for people (in my case, my younger brother) to download photos and videos.

> B+ Tree

{: .highlight-title }
> Huffman File Compressor

{: .highlight-title }
> AVL Tree
>
> This project involved writing a class for an AVL Tree stored in a random access file. Each node contained a certain number of string fields specified by the user, and stored every node in a binary file rather than memory. This was my first project where I regularly read and wrote to a binary file and I discovered I enjoyed being able decode a node from a file rather than relying on it being in memory.
