# About Me

![Picture of me](images/IMG_0388.jpg){:width="30%" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"}
I am entering my junior year at the [University of Wisconsin - La Crosse]. I am double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I enjoy spending my free time outside, hiking and mountain biking. I coach for the local middle school and high school [NICA] mountain bike team. Coaching allows me to get outside and enjoy the bluffs in La Crosse. I first joined the team as a junior in high school, and now fall of 2023 is my third season coaching for the team. Coaching gives me the unique opportunity to practice communication skills between both other coaches and students. I coordinate with other coaches and practice effectively explaining technical concepts to students. Transitioning from a student on the team, to a coach has also given me insight into how to best communicate ideas to students. I have gotten better at stripping ideas down to the necessary details in order to give meaningful instruction without being overwhelming. The communication skills I have acquired from coaching have carried over into non-coaching aspects of my life. In communicating with other students about projects, talking with professors, or explaining my research to a general audience, I am able convey my thoughts more effectively.

I also enjoy solving rubik's cubes. I am able to solve all sorts of rubik's cubes from as small as 2x2 rubik's cubes to as large as 7x7, as well as megaminxs, gear cubes, and pyraminxs. My favorite is the standard 3x3. I have a personal record of 8.68 seconds, and know full [OLL] and full [PLL]. 

More recently, I have gotten into chess. Although I am no grand master, I enjoy playing games online and with my Dad. I find it fascinating watching videos of grand masters explaining their thought process behind games and seeing their level of expertise.
