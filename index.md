# Nathaniel K. Green

My name is Nathaniel K. Green and I am a hard working Mathematics and Computer Science double major from the [University of Wisconsin - La Crosse] who has a passion for learning. Currently, I am interested in artificial intelligence and topology and want to learn about topology's use in artificial intellegence. I have a history of research in the field of optimization and linear algebra, click the link to learn more about my [research]. Here is my [resume]. Here is a link to learn more [about] me.

## Courses:
- Linear Algebra [MTH 309]: 
  * Studied matrices, linear transformations, kernel, range, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, markov chains, diagonalization
- Graph Theory [MTH 317]:
  * Studied planarity, coloring, eulerian and hamiltonian graphs, digraphs, and various graph traversal algorithms
- Differential Equations [MTH 353]:
  * Studied ordinary differential equations, linear/non-linear systems, laplace transformations, wrote numerical approximation programs using python  
- Software Design III [CS 340]:
  * Studied search/sort algorithms and wrote classes for data structures like AVL Tree, B+ Tree, Huffman coding (Java)
- Introduction to Assembler Programming, C Programming and Computer Organization [CS 270]:
  * Project-based course focused on programming in MIPS and C, while studying binary, and types of computers

By Summer 2024: Abstract Algebra, Topology, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Architecture, Software Design IV, Structures of Compilers
