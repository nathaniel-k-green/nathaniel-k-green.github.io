# Projects

The majority of school projects I have done were from my software design III class.

> Video Downloader for Panasonic HC-V785 Camera 
>
> I created a GUI application using Python and PySimpleGUI which downloads video files from a Panasonic HC-V785 Camera and creates a folder with a specific title and the day's date. This project was born out of necessity because there was not a way to download videos from this specific camera without navigating through the terminal or downloading other software. I wanted to build a user-friendly way for people (in my case, my younger brother) to download photos and videos.

> B+ Tree
>
> I wrote a class for a B+ Tree database using Java. I used two random access files, one to store the data, and a second to store the tree structure which pointed to locations in the first file where the corresponding data was stored. This made it so the tree and data did not have to be stored in memory, similar to the AVL Tree project. This specific class allows the user to specify the order of the B+ Tree, and supports the insertion and removal of data, while also allowing the user to print out the tree to screen.

> Huffman File Compressor
>
> This project is a Java program which allows you to compress text files using the Huffman encoding and decoding process. For this, I wrote my own binary heap, decode, encode, input stream, output stream, and tree classes. This involved reading and writing from files and general tree navigation algorithms. The program is able to compress files to roughly 60% of their original size.

> AVL Tree
>
> This project involved writing a class for an AVL Tree stored in a random access file using Java. Each node contained a certain number of string fields specified by the user, and stored every node in a binary file rather than memory. This was my first project where I regularly read and wrote to a binary file and I discovered I enjoyed being able to decode a node from a file rather than relying on it being in memory.

> This Website!
>
> This website is my most recent (and current) project. This project is based on a tempalte called [Just The Docs]. Here is the [repository] for this project. This project uses on Github Pages and Jekyll. Additionally, Jekyll is written in Ruby so there are various spots, such as adding gems, where Ruby is used.
