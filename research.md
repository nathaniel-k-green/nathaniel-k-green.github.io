> I worked with Professor [Edward D. Kim] on the CDTA conjecture. The CDTA states: given $$n\times n$$ symmetric matrices $$A$$ and $$B$$, for all even integers $$m\geq r > 0$$, the coefficient of $$t^r$$ in $$p(t)=\mathsf{trace}((A+tB)^m)$$ is non-negative. For our research, Dr. Kim and I worked on the case when $$m = 6$$ and $$r = 2$$. We used techniques such as semidefinite programming and sums of squares aided by [SageMath].
